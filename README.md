OBS Studio Lua Scripts
======================

About
-----

This is a small collection of [Lua](http://www.lua.org/)
scripts for automating certain tasks and extending the
functionality in the video/audio stream mixing software [OBS
Studio](https://obsproject.com/).

The individual scripts are:

- [auto-execute-commands.lua](auto-execute-commands.lua):<br/>
  Automatically execute commands when OBS Studio starts up and/or
  shuts down. This is usually used for initializing cameras or
  performing similar external start/stop tasks.

- [clone-template-scene.lua](clone-template-scene.lua):<br/>
  Clone an entire source scene (template), by creating a target scene
  (clone) and copying all corresponding sources, including their
  filters, transforms, etc. This is usually used for creating scenes,
  based on the same set of template scenes, during event preparation.

- [keyboard-event-filter.lua](keyboard-event-filter.lua):<br/>
  Define a Keyboard Event filter for sources. This is intended to
  map OBS Studio global hotkeys onto keyboard events for Browser
  Source sources. This is usually used to map global hotkeys (or even
  attached StreamDeck keys) onto keystrokes for Browser Source based
  Head-Up-Display (HUD), Lower Thirds or Banner widgets during event
  production.

- [production-information.lua](production-information.lua):<br/>
  Updates Text/GDI+ sources with the current Preview and Program scene
  information, the current wallclock time and the current on-air
  duration time in order to broadcast this information during production
  to the involved people. This is usually used for broadcasting central
  information during event production.

- [refresh-browser-sources.lua](refresh-browser-sources.lua):<br/>
  Refresh all <i>Browser Source</i> sources. This is usally used to
  refresh Browser Source based Head-Up-Display (HUD), Lower Thirds or
  Banner widgets during event preparation.

- [source-one-of-many.lua](source-one-of-many.lua):<br/>
  Toggle between one of many sources visible in a scene/group. If
  a source is made visible in a scene/group, all other sources are
  automatically made non-visible. The currently already visible source
  is made visible immediately again, if it is accidentally requested
  to be made non-visible. So, at each time, only one source is visible
  within the scene/group. This is usually used for switching between
  multiple cameras within a dedicated scene/group of cameras.

- [enforce-current-scenes.lua](enforce-current-scenes.lua):<br/>
  Enforce certain scenes to be always in preview/program. This is
  usually used when multiple NDI-exported dashboard scenes exists, which
  never should be manually selected, and particular scenes should be in
  preview/program to ensure they are output with the Virtual Camera or
  with a Decklink card.
